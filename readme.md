# DynamoDB Project 
In this project we stick to the concepts of creating a table, loading items into a table, creating, updating and deleting items in a table, querying and scanning a table, creating a table with Local Secondary Index, and finally creating a Global Secondary Index.

## Create a table 
In this step you create a table named Movies

To run the program, type the following command:
```bash
python3 MoviesCreateTable.py
```
