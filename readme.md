# DynamoDB Project 
In this project we stick to the concepts of creating a table, loading items into a table, creating, updating and deleting items in a table, querying and scanning a table, creating a table with Local Secondary Index, and finally creating a Global Secondary Index.

## Create a table 
In this step you create a table named Movies.
Run the file named MoviesCreateTable.py.

To run the program, type the following command:
```bash
python3 MoviesCreateTable.py
```

## Loading sample data
In this step you upload movie1.json file containing the data about movies.
Run the file named MoviesLoadData.py.

To run the program, type the following command:
```bash
python3 MoviesLoadData.py
```

## Creating a new item
In this step you create a new item in the table
Run the file named MoviesItemOps01.py.

To run the program, type the following command:
```bash
python3 MoviesItemOps01.py
```

## Reading an Item
In this step you read an item from the table
Run the file named MoviesItemOps02.py.

To run the program, type the following command:
```bash
python3 MoviesItemOps02.py
```

## Updating an Item
In this step you update an item from the table
Run the file named MoviesItemOps03.py.

To run the program, type the following command:
```bash
python3 MoviesItemOps03.py
```
To atomically increment the rating of a movie run the file named MoviesItemOps04.py.
To conditionally update an item run the file named MoviesItemOps05.py.

## Deleting an item
In this step you delete an item from the table
